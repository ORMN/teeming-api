          "A": "I support the work of the Unity Commission in reforming the Super Delegate system. Many of you have heard me say this -- I never wanted to be a Super Delegate. While Super Delegates didn’t ultimately decide the outcome, the perception that the system was rigged was there. We as party leaders need ensure that the party is open and transparent. All candidates and supporters should have a fair chance to compete and have their voices heard in the process."

          "A": "There’s a reason why Minnesota has the highest general election turnout in the nation. It’s because we work very hard at making making the polls accessible to everyone. We meet people where they are at. Likewise, there’s a reason why the DFL is envied amongst state democratic parties. We meet people where they are, invest in their ideas and knowledge and put the party in their hands. I came up in the caucus system. It’s a pillar of our party, one that I’m proud of. You can look across the country and you won’t find a more grassroots system for a political party. But, we were all there on March1st. We know that the presidential preference ballot brought hundreds of thousand people to caucuses between 6:30 and 8:00pm. Caucuses aren’t set up for that kind of balloting traffic. Evening shift workers, travelers, parents of young kids, people with mobility issues -- no one should ever experience a barrier in participating. Caucuses will still happen for party business, endorsements, all of the like. The party will remain as open as ever. I support the move to a presidential preference ballot being handled by the Secretary of State so that more people can participate. We need to meet people where they're at, just like we have always strived to do."

          "Q": "How will you bring rural, independent Democrats back into the party?",
          "A": "There are a few things we need to do to bring back rural, independent democrats.\n1.    Bernie had it right. That’s not me pandering, it’s just the truth. Bernie’s economic populist message was spot on. We need to craft a narrative that speaks to the knot in people’s stomachs. Rural Minnesotans are hard-working, down to earth people, who have each other’s backs day in and day out. We need to take a page from their book and start fighting for them again. Republicans will fight with anything that moves. We need to start being loud and take back the message the we are the party of the people.\n2.    Bringing back these voters isn’t just going to happen at the voting booth, or at the doors between June and November, or from a mail piece in their already overstuffed mailbox. We’re going to have to get in there and give it some elbow grease. We need to organize every corner of this state. I’ll admit, I’ve made mistakes. One is that we’ve done a majority of our work through the prism of our House and Senate caucuses who set the targets. We can’t do that anymore. We need to organize all corners of this state. I’ve started to put together a plan called One Minnesota. The plan calls for regional offices that serve all 67 senate districts. It’s an expensive plan, one that will require a nose to the grindstone approach to raising the funds, but I’m committed to doing the leg work needed so that every part of the state has an office and staff that will help them during an election and during the off year.\n3.    There are a lot of rural party units that are exhausted. We have party chairs and vice chairs that have been in those positions for years longer than they would have liked because no one else wants to pick up the torch. There are also lots of leadership positions that are left open year after year. Our Revolution MN has done a great job of pinpointing that as a hole that they can help fill to improve our party. I hope to continue our partnership with organizations like your own to help pinpoint those units and positions where we can recruit someone with new ideas and energy. What we saw during the primary is that there is passion and energy in rural Minnesota, but we need to give those people a place in the party if we really are serious about bringing life into local units in rural Minnesota."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How will you recruit new candidates to run for public office?",
          "A": "The One Minnesota plan calls for early recruitment of candidates. Regardless of if I’m elected again or not, we need to get our candidates out on the doors early so that meaningful conversations can happen, instead of the transactional conversations that happen during the heat of an election. But we first need to figure out who those candidates are going to be. There are 67 senate districts, 134 house districts and of course we will have incumbents run in a portion of those seats, but nevertheless, candidate recruitment is a big job. I want to do a few things here:\n1.        Recruit from and for nonpartisan offices. Deep organizing means that we can’t forget about our local offices like city council and school board. Matt Little was elected to the Senate this year in part because he developed relationships with his community through his work on the city council and as mayor. That’s the type of organizing that we need to do more of. We need to find these sitting local office holders and recruit them to run for our legislative seats. There are a lot of local units who are really delving into this, but as a party we can be doing more.\n2.        Partnerships with organizations like Our Revolution are important. Organizations have a unique perspective and can help identify community leaders who would make great candidates.\n3.        Previously, the caucuses would promise candidates the moon and not be able to deliver in non-targeted races. With the One Minnesota plan we can offer candidates tangible assistance so that when we are recruiting candidates, they know exactly what kind of assistance they will have. Running for office is a stressful, time consuming, and sometimes scary decision. The Party has a responsibility to the candidates that we recruit."

          "Q": "What is the role of DFL Party officers in endorsing and supporting candidates?",
          "A": "DFL Party Officers are bound by the constitution to abide by our endorsed candidates in legislative and statewide races. The only race that we are personally allowed to endorse is in presidential races. I know this caused a lot controversy and it seemed like I was putting my finger on the scale for Hillary. I want to assure you that I didn’t. Please don’t take my word for it, talk to members of his team here in Minnesota. Bernie’s victory in Minnesota was because of the hard work that your members, his supporters and his staff did. It was a wonderfully run campaign. I worked closely with his campaign to make sure that the DFL provided what it could to it. We held frequent meetings and had many conversations with the state campaign and national campaign. I advocated for changes on the platform committee so that Rep. Keith Ellison could represent Minnesota and I did my best to make sure the Bernie national delegates had their requests met and voices heard at the National Convention. I want to acknowledge that it was a tense primary, and we still have work to do. I’m committed to bringing in the new voices that supported Bernie, I’m committed to bringing Bernie’s message into the party, and I’m committed to making sure that we work together to ensure that in 2018 we win for the people of Minnesota."

          "Q": "How do you plan to win elections (ie. campaign political philosophy)?",
          "A": "I was very honored to be a founding board member for Minnesotans United. What that campaign taught everyone was that meaningful, long form conversations can change minds and motivate people in a way that transactional conversations just can’t. Winning elections is always about people. Door knocking is incredibly important. Those conversations are campaign gold, but we need to start really investing in earlier conversations. We need to get candidates out earlier. My goal is to have our candidates in the game by this summer so that they can start having meaningful, long form conversations long before the election. Meaningful conversations aren’t just left to the candidates. Deep organizing means that regardless of candidacy, we all need to take our conversations to our closest circles. Research shows that people are much more likely to believe someone if they are a trusted messenger--a family member, a church member, a friend, a teammate. I know that those conversations can be uncomfortable. My father is a Republican, my father-in-law is a Republican, my union member brother voted for Trump. But, we are going to have to be uncomfortable to fight for what we know is right. There were quite a few people who said we needed to stop talking about identity politics to win back rural Minnesota. I think that’s wrong. There is no reason this is an either or battle. We can fight for marginalized communities and we can fight for rural Minnesota. If we can speak to the knot in people’s stomachs with economic populist message, we can talk to all of Minnesota."

          "Q": "What is your vision for the future of the DFL Party regarding the independent grassroots organizations (ie Black Lives Matter, Our Revolution, TakeAction Minnesota)?",
          "A": "Sometimes the DFL isn’t the right leader for the charge. Everyone expects me to be loud and speak out against what’s happening on a state and national level. It’s politics as usual. Independent grassroots organizations like Our Revolution, BLM, TakeAction, Indivisible, and Stand Up MN have a unique ability to show the world that these issues aren’t just partisan politics. Right now the DFL needs to support and lift up these organizations, not co-op their energy. I look forward to continuing work with these independent organizations and continue to develop relationships with the new ones that have emerged over the last year. Working against each other and duplicating efforts won’t help us win. But cooperation and support will lead us to progressive victories. I am proud of the cooperative work that the DFL and these organizations have done in the past, and look forward to forming new partnerships to advance progressive politics in Minnesota."

          "Q": "What is your plan to raise money to support the DFL Party reforms and future campaigns?",
          "A": "From 1990-2005 we had the largest small donor program in the country coming in at 30,000 donors. When I inherited the party, our small donor program had been reduced to an alarmingly low 3,000 donors. For those of you who have experience in non-profits, you’ll understand that a strong organization is built on a strong small donor program. Bernie is one of the best examples of this. He had sustainable support through his small donor program -- $27.00! During my six years as DFL Chair, we have rebuilt our small donor program back into one of the strongest in the country, but we can always do better. I plan on focusing on building on our strong small donor program so that our campaigns and party programs are sustainably resourced and that our party is funded by the people."

          "Q": "Why are you running for office?",
          "A": "I am running for re-election to be Chair of the MN DFL. I never set out to be the chair of this party. When Governor Dayton asked me to run for the position, my first reaction was far from enthusiastic. But as you know, we have a pretty fierce and persuasive governor and long story short, here I am. Being front and center isn’t my calling. I was happy to run progressive campaigns from the background because I believed in them. I wanted change and I wanted people’s lives to be better. I still do. There are campaign operatives and consultants who will work on anything. I could never do that. That’s not who I am. I believe in this party. I believe in the values of the DFL. I am a proud Democrat, and even prouder DFLer. I have been in this party for decades and no matter what happens on March 4th, I will always be a proud and active member of this party. I didn’t know if I was going to run again. I felt defeated after the election in November. Devastated, defeated, disenchanted, all the bad “D” words. But then I spoke to my neighbors from India, Vietnam, and Venezuela. Instead of their usual inquisitiveness about what I was up to in the political world, they were outwardly fearful. There kids were scared. My kids are white, they don’t have that same fear. I decided then that I couldn’t give up because people are counting on us. The party is stronger organizationally and financially than it ever has been. We had more offices and feet on the ground this election than we ever have before. The Republicans have had to rely on outside groups like the MN Jobs Coalition to do their bidding, but because of the DFL’s organizational and financial stability and the relationships we have with our partners, we are at the center of electoral strategy and have the ability to support our candidates. We have a very important election coming up. If we don’t win the gubernatorial, we’re sunk. We will be just like Wisconsin. I’m running because we can’t go backwards, we need to keep moving forward. I committed to learning from mistakes, building on successes, and bringing in new people to our party. We can’t afford to be in debt and organizationally scattered. I’m running to move this party forward so that we can better people’s lives."

          "Q": "What are your top three priorities once elected?",
          "A": "The three top priorities for me are\n1) making sure that we continue ensuring that our party is diverse and inclusive\n2) that we organize and build our party throughout the state with deep organizing in rural Minnesota and\n3) Crafting a narrative for the DFL that speaks to people’s anxiety and helps us win the Governors race."

          "Q": "Why are you the best person to address these issues?",
          "A": "DFLers aren’t cookie cutter. They have differing issues that they care about. We saw this at the last State Central Committee meeting. But, what makes the DFL a strong party is that we can find common ground. We might not always support the same candidate in the primary, we may not always hold the same positions on a topic, and we may not all agree on a proposed platform amendment, but we have a grassroots party that allows for those disagreements, even welcomes them. I’m the chair of the DFL. I don’t draft policy and I don’t decide what the DFL platform says or does, that’s up to all of you. What I can do is bring us all together to fight for what we all can rally behind. I’m the only person in the race right now who has brought all of our parties branches together to sit at the same table. As DFL Chair, you are responsible to stakeholder groups -- party leaders and activists, elected officials and candidates, and progressive partners, allies and donors. Before I was chair, no one was sitting at the same table. We had massive debt and an organization that didn’t show what we had gotten for our money. I have the relationships and the experience to make sure that when we are making decisions, we have all the pieces and the ability to execute plans. We can talk a good talk, but unless we have the resources and relationships to act, we don’t have anything."

          "Q": "How will you use your candidacy/elected official position to engage more citizens in the political process?",
          "A": "One of the things I am most proud of is that we’ve opened up the Party. I believe in inclusiveness. People can talk about diversity, but unless those voices are given power and leadership, those are just feel good stats. We have the most diverse staff in DFL history and the most diverse leadership in DFL history. I urged for the addition of 50 at-large state central committee spots, most of which were filled by Bernie supporters, and 50 positions for local government officials. I am proud of the work we’ve done to engage more people in our party, not just so our stats would look better, but so we our party had the voices in it to reflect our values. We need an inclusive party if we are serious about what we believe in. I am looking forward to continuing my efforts to open up the party and building relationships with organizations like Our Revolution MN and Stand Up MN. One of the projects that I am really looking forward to is working with Our Revolution MN in filling leadership vacancies around the state with fresh voices. One Minnesota calls for statewide offices to service every part of the state. One of the paramount pieces of the plan is hiring people to staff those offices locally. Local people have local knowledge and insights that we can’t possible know from St. Paul. By giving support to the local party units, by hiring a local person who has the support of the state party, we will hopefully engage more people to the party in parts of the state that haven’t gotten much attention."

          "Q": "Describe your experiences and skill sets that will help you be effective in office.",
          "A": "I’ve spent my entire career in progressive politics. I got my start with Paul Wellstone and spent the next 27 years working on progressive campaigns. I have been involved in all levels of campaigns. From being Rep. Sandra Masin’s treasurer to leading Governor Dayton’s re-count efforts, to working on issue campaigns--I was a founding board member of Minnesotans United and ran the largest clean water initiative campaign in the nation. I know what it takes to run an effective campaign. I also know how to help other campaigns be successful. The DFL isn’t a candidate. Candidate’s win their campaigns. But the DFL can add value to a campaign and help push it over the top. I have shown that we can do this. Our elected officials endorsed me because the DFL under my leadership provided support to their campaigns that wasn’t there before. I have proven that we can build relationships between our partners. Our partners used to act around us because we didn’t have the capacity to be at the table. That’s not the case anymore. I set a goal to develop relationships that had been previously frayed and I accomplished that goal. We now have robust relationships with party leaders and activists, elected officials and candidates, progressive partners, allies and donors.. The DFL needs those partners if we want to be successful going forward. The part of politics everyone hates and doesn’t like to talk about--money. Grassroots aren’t free. Money shouldn’t matter more than people and that’s why the DFL invests money into people. This last year we had the most organizers on the ground in the history of the DFL. We had a base program that was devoted to organizing in communities of color, by hiring people from those communities. We developed an entire program, the Red to Blue program, to work with non-targeted candidates. These are vital programs, but they are expensive. We can’t go into debt every time there is an election. There is always an election. I’ve proven that I can raise the money to fund these programs. We’re looking at implementing one of the most ambitious statewide programs in DFL history. It’s expensive. Very expensive. My ability to raise funds for our programs and our electoral strategies is going to be very important going into this existential period in our state and country's history."

          "Q": "Citizens (people) before Corporations",
          "A": "Citizens United was a catastrophic ruling by the Supreme Court. The DFL believes that people are people. The Supreme Court's decision undermined the foundations of our democracy. As Lincoln so eloquently put it, our government should be for the people, by the people, and of the people. As the chair of the DFL I committed to fighting for the people. Our government should not be beholden to corporate interests over the interests of the people."

          "A": "Voters decide elections. They go to the polls. We need to make sure that we continue to put money into people power. Donors have a place in our party. Without them we can't pay for offices, hire staff like field organizers, build robust coordinated campaigns, or assist local party units. As previously mentioned, our small donor program is one of the best in the country, which was no small feat after inheriting a deteriorating program. I am going to continue to build this program and invest the funds in programs and resources that are centered on people and voters. I've been traveling the state recently, and I agree with what a lot of our rural Minnesota DFLers are saying--they need more resources. There's a cost to it. But raising the money doesn't mean we aren't focused on voters. It means that we value our local units enough to invest in their needs. I will continue to raise funds for our party and invest them in voters and our Party. The grassroots aren't free, but if we put our money into grassroots organizing and into the people, then we're putting our money where our mouth is."

          "Q": "People, Planet and Peace before Profits",
          "A": "The DFL is one of the most grassroots party in the nation. We have one of the largest state central committees with one of the most open processes to getting involved. What I've seen in my time as an activist and the chair is that our people are committed to people, the planet and peace before profits. It's not my place to make policy or take my personal beliefs and paste them onto the DFL. That's the type of top down approach that I think is inappropriate for a chair to assume. I will fight for our party values. I would have never gotten involved in this party if we weren't the party of the people, who believe in science, and who advocate for peace before profits. We may disagree with how all the pieces fit together. The last state central committee was an example of this. But, I am proud to be a part of a party that takes the time to have these disagreements and can come out stronger from them. I will always be guided by our common principles, no matter my position within the party."

That's why I have made it a continual goal of mine to open this party up like it has never been done before. Not just stats, but actually inclusion. We've done good work so far. I have worked hard to expand our constituency caucuses, and put members of those caucuses on the state executive board. My staff is the most diverse staff that the DFL has ever had. I advocated and fought for there to be 50 additional at-large delegates on the state central committee. We revamped our coordinated campaign into being a base organizing campaign, focusing on organizing people of color that historically don't receive the attention that they deserve during an election season. We hired people from those communities to organize. We have invested money, staff, time, and man power into campaigns like the Vote No campaign on the voter ID amendment because access to the ballot for ALL people is what Minnesota is about. I was a founding board member of Minnesotans United and worked tirelessly so that Minnesota would stand up for our fellow Minnesotans who faced discrimination because of who they loved. I ran the largest clean water initiative in the countries history because clean water is a right and not a privilege. Dignity, Equity and Justice for All Persons means that we don't back down when we know something is wrong. We don't shy away when the fight is tough, because we know what is right. People of color, immigrants, indigenous people, people with disabilities, are all a part of this party. This is anyone's party and we all have a responsibility to welcome new people in. I know that there are barriers for people and I am committed to continuing to knock those barriers down. It's my responsibility as chair to make sure that this party is the party of the people -- all people."

My support for Hillary though doesn’t negate the appreciation I have for Bernie Sanders. I’ve admired his work in the Senate and admire the grassroots campaign he ran and the energy he ignited.

Clearly, rural voters feel left behind by the DFL Party though I don't believe we lost to the Republicans. I believe we have not done our job to communicate to rural voters that we hear them, understand their struggles, and will stand with and fight for them. We need to begin having issue-based authentic conversations throughout rural Minnesota. Whether through a canvass or through local events, potentially with allied partners, we need to first listen to the concerns of folks and through these authentic conversations we can learn what resonates with people locally. Through this relationship building and potential organizing around local issues, and through telling stories of those impacted by negative policies, we can shape what will then become local campaign issues and can help shape messaging, that will speak to the community, as it's come from the community. It's a grassroots approach that relies on organizing instead of over-relying on polling and consultants."

Often there is a last-minute scramble to simply put someone on the ballot as a DFLer, simply to fill a spot. My plan is to build out a program for intentional recruitment, beginning now. I will invite the Legislative Caucuses to rethink how we recruit candidates together to build a bench to elect DFLers. Beginning now, we should assess the opportunities in each legislative district and in local non-partisan races. I'd like the State Party to work with the Caucuses and local Party leaders to identify potential candidates, ideally, arising out of local organizing/ advocacy. Not only do we need to reimagine how we recruit candidates, we need to commit to training and supporting local candidates -- particularly in rural MN, where we've suffered great losses. If we're asking a candidate to run and they courageously step forward, I believe we must clearly communicate what it will take and we must be willing to lend guidance and support, regardless if it is a targeted race, in order to build in areas where multiple runs may be required. I don't think candidate recruitment can be one size fits all. We need to tailor approaches that reflect the input of local folks."

I have made a public pledge regarding this issue: When the Party appears to favor one candidate over another it disrespects our democratic traditions and damages our ability to come together in unity. The Chair must remain neutral in everything the Party oversees so all stakeholders feel that the process has integrity and is fair. As your State Party Chair, I pledge to remain neutral in all state and local endorsement contests until after the appropriate convention. I further pledge to remain neutral in the presidential contest until after Minnesota's presidential primary. This neutrality will also apply to the State DFL office and staff."

          "A": "To lay the groundwork in order to win elections, following the time I've spent listening to DFL activists throughout the state during this campaign for Chair, we'll prioritize organizing throughout the state to listen to and gain an understanding of the concerns of voters. We will create a culture within the Party that is welcoming to new people and ideas, is inclusive, and that trusts that people know their communities best in order to build ownership of the Party. I will meet with and check in with Congressional District chairs regularly, to hear how the State Party can best support the work of local units in order to provide that support to grow and strengthen local units. I will meet with progressive allies and elected officials to explore partnering surrounding issue-based organizing and advocacy to build grassroots power together and relationships that may potentially evolve into doing electoral work together. I will meet with coordinated campaign partners to understand their individual goals and then convene the table to find common ground to begin laying the groundwork for a strong coordinated campaign, early. We'll build a strong team of staff members that will develop and execute communications and field plans with partners. And to fund this, I will re-establish and build new donor relationships with both institutional and movement donors, while expanding our grassroots donor base. All of this will build grassroots power to fuel our electoral infrastructure. I am honored to have served as State DFL Associate Chair for six years, from 2005 to 2011. In my first election cycle leading the Party in 2006, we won back the State Legislature and got Amy Klobuchar, Lori Swanson, Rebecca Otto, Mark Ritchie, Keith Ellison, and Tim Walz elected. In 2008, we got Al Franken elected. In 2010, Mark Dayton — the first DFL Governor elected in 24 years! When I started as Associate Chair in 2005, we held only two of the seven statewide offices. When I left in 2011, we held seven out of seven — and we have ever since. We did this by investing in organizing, getting out of Saint Paul, building a connected state, earning the trust of partners, building great teams and strong coordinated campaigns, and raised the money necessary. We can do this again."

          "Q": "What is your vision for the future of the DFL Party regarding the independent grassroots organizations (ie Black Lives Matter, Our Revolution, TakeAction Minnesota)?",
          "A": "The DFL Party must respect the people power that independent grassroots organizations build, and look to learn from them and potentially partner with them. It's going to take all of us to resist, fight and build with our current president and a Republican legislature. We can no longer afford to have the Party distance itself or compete with progressive organizations that are building power through organizing efforts that serve their memberships. And we need to be open to partnering with grassroots organizations. I have followed the lead of BLM from its inception, having marched, prayed, sang and participated in civil disobedience with them. Our Revolution has the potential to engage and mobilize folks around issues that are important to folks throughout Minnesota. And as a TakeAction Minnesota member, and a Minnesotans for a Fair Economy partner I have worked extensively with, I will look for ways to partner with TAMN. As an example, right now if I were Chair of the DFL Party, we'd be partnering with the Labor and community organizations packing the hearings opposing the Local Interference bills of the Republicans, which would prohibit local governments from being responsive to their residents with measures like Earned Sick and Safe time, which many organizations came together around to pass in Minneapolis and Saint Paul."

        {
          "Q": "What is your plan to raise money to support the DFL Party reforms and future campaigns?",
          "A": "Maintaining and establishing relationships with longtime Party donors, and clearly communicating how year-round issue-based organizing and building grassroots power will grow and strengthen the Party to prepare for elections. Through connecting with large numbers of grassroots activists and by showing up differently in communities throughout Minnesota, we'll increase our low-dollar donor base, which will build a connection with these voters."

        {
          "Q": "Why are you running for office?",
          "A": "I'm running to serve as the State Chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. In the 2016, the Republicans took over the Legislature. They won our one open congressional seat with a candidate you can hardly tell apart from Donald Trump. And Minnesota did the unthinkable -- we nearly went Trump. The Republicans came closer to winning our electoral votes than they have in 44 years. And we're the only state in the nation that went for Hillary that flipped a legislative chamber from Democratic to Republican. I don't believe the Republicans won. We didn't do our job. The Party failed to communicate to working people throughout our state, that we see and hear their struggles and will stand with and fight with them. Under the current leadership, the Party has moved away from investing in organizing, has been less clear in communicating that we stand with working people, has become more metro-centric, is losing its connection to our rural communities, and has moved away from truly coordinated electoral campaigns. And we have failed to engage our base communities around issues that affect their lives on an ongoing basis. Instead, the Party has over-relied on polling, consultants, mail and TV ads, rather than doing what we know works -- having effective conversations with voters. We lost legislative seats in 2014. We lost more legislative seats in 2016. We cannot afford this trend in 2018 and 2020 if we are to retain the governorship and have any say in redistricting. Moving a progressive agenda forward will be difficult. And as we face a Trump presidency and a Republican Legislature, we need new thinking. We need a Chair that values organizing and voter education, has demonstrated the ability to win elections and issue-based campaigns in innovative ways with strategic partners. And that has extensive experience in movement politics. Having successfully served as the DFL Party's Associate Chair from 2005-11 and as the Executive Director of Minnesotans for a Fair Economy from 2011-16, I am best prepared to help lift the DFL Party to new heights. I will share more about these two professional experiences below."

        {
          "Q": "What are your top three priorities once elected?",
          "A": "1. Invest in deep organizing. We need to spend time in communities throughout Minnesota, having issue-based conversations that are important to people, allowing us to understand one another and build relationships. Not only will this be helpful in shaping local messaging; it will help us identify local candidates and new people to invite into the Party. So many, particularly young people and women, were energized by last year's presidential election. They want to do meaningful work. I want them to land in the Minnesota DFL -- perhaps in their local organizing unit, perhaps in a constituency caucus, or perhaps through a progressive ally organization. And we can partner with organizations like Our Rev and TakeAction Minnesota for events like the recent informational and action meeting surrounding saving Obamacare, Medicare and Planned Parenthood funding. All of which, will allow us to engage people in our political and public lives.\n2. Convene the legislative caucuses, elected officials and party activists to rethink how we recruit local candidates to build a bench and elect DFLers, as explained earlier.\n3. Deepen and broaden our relationships with organized Labor and other progressive allies. We must partner in new ways to not only tell, but show, workers, immigrants, communities of color, LGBTQ folks, climate justice advocates, people of the Muslim faith and all faiths, that we stand with them and will fight with them. This could take the form of civic engagement, legislative advocacy, or direct action. The point is that we will break down the walls between the Party and outside groups that are doing powerful work year-round, helping change the narrative in Minnesota around economic, racial, social and environmental justice."

          "A": "I will implement grassroots issue-based organizing and advocacy throughout Minnesota, within the Party and also in partnership with base-building organizations. We will invite people into the Party to do meaningful work through constituency caucuses, advocacy work, precinct caucuses and electoral campaigns."

        {
          "Q": "Describe your experiences and skill sets that will help you be effective in office.",
          "A": "I have been a community organizer for the last 30 years. My work in electoral and movement politics make me best suited to lead the DFL Party in the age of Trump and with a Republican Legislature, where new thinking will be required. I previously entered into Party leadership, serving as the State DFL Associate Chair in 2005, shortly after we lost the election to George W. Bush, and when we had a divided Legislature and a Republican governor. Folks felt deflated. We built a great teams. We invested in organizing and ran effective communications and field plans. In 2006, we took back the Legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar, Mark Ritchie, Lori Swanson, Rebecca Otto, Tim Walz (unseating a six-term Republican) and Keith Ellison (in a brutal primary campaign). In 2008 we elected Al Franken, unseating a Republican incumbent, and helped elect the President. In 2010 we helped elect the first DFL governor in 24 years! When I began in this role, the DFL Party held only two of the statewide offices. When I left in 2011 we held all seven, and have ever since. Since then I have served as the Executive Director of Minnesotans for a Fair Economy. MFE is an alignment of labor, faith and community groups addressing economic, racial, social and environmental justice issues. We have been successful in numerous coordinated campaigns addressing corporate accountability, income inequality and racial equity in workplaces, municipalities, at the Legislature and at the ballot box. Victories include helping to raise the minimum wage at the state level, going up against the Big Banks to pass the Homeowner's Bill of Rights to protect families against foreclosure, and passing earned sick and safe time in Minneapolis and St. Paul. One of the campaigns I'm most proud of is the Our Vote Our Future campaign. In 2012, the Republicans put on the ballot a constitutional amendment to require photo ID. A Star Tribune poll showed 80% support for photo ID. The current leadership, whose decision-making over-relies on polling, felt this fight was unwinnable. With our democracy at stake, our table decided that we couldn't not fight it. My team conducted the research and we put together a communications and field plan, and built out a campaign with partner organizations that defeated the amendment with 54% of the vote. Had we relied on the polling, many voices would have been left out of our elections. Instead, with a deep belief that tough campaigns can only be won with smart strategies and through organizing, we were successful by people talking to people throughout the state of Minnesota. My skills include the ability to build talented and creative teams to do hard things - win difficult electoral and advocacy campaigns by building people power through grassroots organizing. I'm an excellent manager, and oversee research, communications and field plan development and execution. I am skilled in building powerful strategic partnerships, in serving as a spokesperson, and in fundraising."

          "Q": "Why is an Our Revolution MN endorsement important to you?",
          "A": "Establishment politics has allowed for the concentration of wealth and power, and by extension, our democracy, into the hands of a very few. Change will only come from the grassroots. That is, organized people working in partnership, educating voters, electing progressive candidates in order to move forward a pro-worker agenda, racial equity, environmental justice, corporate accountability and more. Bernie Sanders's historic presidential campaign engaged, energized and mobilized grassroots support like nothing we've seen before. It's inspiring that Bernie's supporters have remained engaged through Our Revolution, which is a testament to the grassroots power that was built through the Sanders campaign. That is absolutely essential to creating change by moving forward a progressive agenda. I will stand and organize with members of Our Rev MN, both inside and outside of the Party, to continue to build power for the movement."
