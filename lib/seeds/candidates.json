          "A": "I support the work of the Unity Commission in reforming the Super Delegate system. Many of you have heard me say this -- I never wanted to be a Super Delegate. While Super Delegates didn’t ultimately decide the outcome, the perception that the system was rigged was there. We as party leaders need ensure that the party is open and transparent. All candidates and supporters should have a fair chance to compete and have their voices heard in the process."

          "A": "There’s a reason why Minnesota has the highest general election turnout in the nation. It’s because we work very hard at making making the polls accessible to everyone. We meet people where they are at. Likewise, there’s a reason why the DFL is envied amongst state democratic parties. We meet people where they are, invest in their ideas and knowledge and put the party in their hands. I came up in the caucus system. It’s a pillar of our party, one that I’m proud of. You can look across the country and you won’t find a more grassroots system for a political party. But, we were all there on March1st. We know that the presidential preference ballot brought hundreds of thousand people to caucuses between 6:30 and 8:00pm. Caucuses aren’t set up for that kind of balloting traffic. Evening shift workers, travelers, parents of young kids, people with mobility issues -- no one should ever experience a barrier in participating. Caucuses will still happen for party business, endorsements, all of the like. The party will remain as open as ever. I support the move to a presidential preference ballot being handled by the Secretary of State so that more people can participate. We need to meet people where they're at, just like we have always strived to do."

          "Q": "How will you bring rural, independent Democrats back into the party?",
          "A": "There are a few things we need to do to bring back rural, independent democrats.\n1.    Bernie had it right. That’s not me pandering, it’s just the truth. Bernie’s economic populist message was spot on. We need to craft a narrative that speaks to the knot in people’s stomachs. Rural Minnesotans are hard-working, down to earth people, who have each other’s backs day in and day out. We need to take a page from their book and start fighting for them again. Republicans will fight with anything that moves. We need to start being loud and take back the message the we are the party of the people.\n2.    Bringing back these voters isn’t just going to happen at the voting booth, or at the doors between June and November, or from a mail piece in their already overstuffed mailbox. We’re going to have to get in there and give it some elbow grease. We need to organize every corner of this state. I’ll admit, I’ve made mistakes. One is that we’ve done a majority of our work through the prism of our House and Senate caucuses who set the targets. We can’t do that anymore. We need to organize all corners of this state. I’ve started to put together a plan called One Minnesota. The plan calls for regional offices that serve all 67 senate districts. It’s an expensive plan, one that will require a nose to the grindstone approach to raising the funds, but I’m committed to doing the leg work needed so that every part of the state has an office and staff that will help them during an election and during the off year.\n3.    There are a lot of rural party units that are exhausted. We have party chairs and vice chairs that have been in those positions for years longer than they would have liked because no one else wants to pick up the torch. There are also lots of leadership positions that are left open year after year. Our Revolution MN has done a great job of pinpointing that as a hole that they can help fill to improve our party. I hope to continue our partnership with organizations like your own to help pinpoint those units and positions where we can recruit someone with new ideas and energy. What we saw during the primary is that there is passion and energy in rural Minnesota, but we need to give those people a place in the party if we really are serious about bringing life into local units in rural Minnesota."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How will you recruit new candidates to run for public office?",
          "A": "The One Minnesota plan calls for early recruitment of candidates. Regardless of if I’m elected again or not, we need to get our candidates out on the doors early so that meaningful conversations can happen, instead of the transactional conversations that happen during the heat of an election. But we first need to figure out who those candidates are going to be. There are 67 senate districts, 134 house districts and of course we will have incumbents run in a portion of those seats, but nevertheless, candidate recruitment is a big job. I want to do a few things here:\n1.        Recruit from and for nonpartisan offices. Deep organizing means that we can’t forget about our local offices like city council and school board. Matt Little was elected to the Senate this year in part because he developed relationships with his community through his work on the city council and as mayor. That’s the type of organizing that we need to do more of. We need to find these sitting local office holders and recruit them to run for our legislative seats. There are a lot of local units who are really delving into this, but as a party we can be doing more.\n2.        Partnerships with organizations like Our Revolution are important. Organizations have a unique perspective and can help identify community leaders who would make great candidates.\n3.        Previously, the caucuses would promise candidates the moon and not be able to deliver in non-targeted races. With the One Minnesota plan we can offer candidates tangible assistance so that when we are recruiting candidates, they know exactly what kind of assistance they will have. Running for office is a stressful, time consuming, and sometimes scary decision. The Party has a responsibility to the candidates that we recruit."

          "Q": "What is the role of DFL Party officers in endorsing and supporting candidates?",
          "A": "DFL Party Officers are bound by the constitution to abide by our endorsed candidates in legislative and statewide races. The only race that we are personally allowed to endorse is in presidential races. I know this caused a lot controversy and it seemed like I was putting my finger on the scale for Hillary. I want to assure you that I didn’t. Please don’t take my word for it, talk to members of his team here in Minnesota. Bernie’s victory in Minnesota was because of the hard work that your members, his supporters and his staff did. It was a wonderfully run campaign. I worked closely with his campaign to make sure that the DFL provided what it could to it. We held frequent meetings and had many conversations with the state campaign and national campaign. I advocated for changes on the platform committee so that Rep. Keith Ellison could represent Minnesota and I did my best to make sure the Bernie national delegates had their requests met and voices heard at the National Convention. I want to acknowledge that it was a tense primary, and we still have work to do. I’m committed to bringing in the new voices that supported Bernie, I’m committed to bringing Bernie’s message into the party, and I’m committed to making sure that we work together to ensure that in 2018 we win for the people of Minnesota."

          "Q": "How do you plan to win elections (ie. campaign political philosophy)?",
          "A": "I was very honored to be a founding board member for Minnesotans United. What that campaign taught everyone was that meaningful, long form conversations can change minds and motivate people in a way that transactional conversations just can’t. Winning elections is always about people. Door knocking is incredibly important. Those conversations are campaign gold, but we need to start really investing in earlier conversations. We need to get candidates out earlier. My goal is to have our candidates in the game by this summer so that they can start having meaningful, long form conversations long before the election. Meaningful conversations aren’t just left to the candidates. Deep organizing means that regardless of candidacy, we all need to take our conversations to our closest circles. Research shows that people are much more likely to believe someone if they are a trusted messenger--a family member, a church member, a friend, a teammate. I know that those conversations can be uncomfortable. My father is a Republican, my father-in-law is a Republican, my union member brother voted for Trump. But, we are going to have to be uncomfortable to fight for what we know is right. There were quite a few people who said we needed to stop talking about identity politics to win back rural Minnesota. I think that’s wrong. There is no reason this is an either or battle. We can fight for marginalized communities and we can fight for rural Minnesota. If we can speak to the knot in people’s stomachs with economic populist message, we can talk to all of Minnesota."

          "Q": "What is your vision for the future of the DFL Party regarding the independent grassroots organizations (ie Black Lives Matter, Our Revolution, TakeAction Minnesota)?",
          "A": "Sometimes the DFL isn’t the right leader for the charge. Everyone expects me to be loud and speak out against what’s happening on a state and national level. It’s politics as usual. Independent grassroots organizations like Our Revolution, BLM, TakeAction, Indivisible, and Stand Up MN have a unique ability to show the world that these issues aren’t just partisan politics. Right now the DFL needs to support and lift up these organizations, not co-op their energy. I look forward to continuing work with these independent organizations and continue to develop relationships with the new ones that have emerged over the last year. Working against each other and duplicating efforts won’t help us win. But cooperation and support will lead us to progressive victories. I am proud of the cooperative work that the DFL and these organizations have done in the past, and look forward to forming new partnerships to advance progressive politics in Minnesota."

          "Q": "What is your plan to raise money to support the DFL Party reforms and future campaigns?",
          "A": "From 1990-2005 we had the largest small donor program in the country coming in at 30,000 donors. When I inherited the party, our small donor program had been reduced to an alarmingly low 3,000 donors. For those of you who have experience in non-profits, you’ll understand that a strong organization is built on a strong small donor program. Bernie is one of the best examples of this. He had sustainable support through his small donor program -- $27.00! During my six years as DFL Chair, we have rebuilt our small donor program back into one of the strongest in the country, but we can always do better. I plan on focusing on building on our strong small donor program so that our campaigns and party programs are sustainably resourced and that our party is funded by the people."

          "Q": "Why are you running for office?",
          "A": "I am running for re-election to be Chair of the MN DFL. I never set out to be the chair of this party. When Governor Dayton asked me to run for the position, my first reaction was far from enthusiastic. But as you know, we have a pretty fierce and persuasive governor and long story short, here I am. Being front and center isn’t my calling. I was happy to run progressive campaigns from the background because I believed in them. I wanted change and I wanted people’s lives to be better. I still do. There are campaign operatives and consultants who will work on anything. I could never do that. That’s not who I am. I believe in this party. I believe in the values of the DFL. I am a proud Democrat, and even prouder DFLer. I have been in this party for decades and no matter what happens on March 4th, I will always be a proud and active member of this party. I didn’t know if I was going to run again. I felt defeated after the election in November. Devastated, defeated, disenchanted, all the bad “D” words. But then I spoke to my neighbors from India, Vietnam, and Venezuela. Instead of their usual inquisitiveness about what I was up to in the political world, they were outwardly fearful. There kids were scared. My kids are white, they don’t have that same fear. I decided then that I couldn’t give up because people are counting on us. The party is stronger organizationally and financially than it ever has been. We had more offices and feet on the ground this election than we ever have before. The Republicans have had to rely on outside groups like the MN Jobs Coalition to do their bidding, but because of the DFL’s organizational and financial stability and the relationships we have with our partners, we are at the center of electoral strategy and have the ability to support our candidates. We have a very important election coming up. If we don’t win the gubernatorial, we’re sunk. We will be just like Wisconsin. I’m running because we can’t go backwards, we need to keep moving forward. I committed to learning from mistakes, building on successes, and bringing in new people to our party. We can’t afford to be in debt and organizationally scattered. I’m running to move this party forward so that we can better people’s lives."

          "Q": "What are your top three priorities once elected?",
          "A": "The three top priorities for me are\n1) making sure that we continue ensuring that our party is diverse and inclusive\n2) that we organize and build our party throughout the state with deep organizing in rural Minnesota and\n3) Crafting a narrative for the DFL that speaks to people’s anxiety and helps us win the Governors race."

          "Q": "Why are you the best person to address these issues?",
          "A": "DFLers aren’t cookie cutter. They have differing issues that they care about. We saw this at the last State Central Committee meeting. But, what makes the DFL a strong party is that we can find common ground. We might not always support the same candidate in the primary, we may not always hold the same positions on a topic, and we may not all agree on a proposed platform amendment, but we have a grassroots party that allows for those disagreements, even welcomes them. I’m the chair of the DFL. I don’t draft policy and I don’t decide what the DFL platform says or does, that’s up to all of you. What I can do is bring us all together to fight for what we all can rally behind. I’m the only person in the race right now who has brought all of our parties branches together to sit at the same table. As DFL Chair, you are responsible to stakeholder groups -- party leaders and activists, elected officials and candidates, and progressive partners, allies and donors. Before I was chair, no one was sitting at the same table. We had massive debt and an organization that didn’t show what we had gotten for our money. I have the relationships and the experience to make sure that when we are making decisions, we have all the pieces and the ability to execute plans. We can talk a good talk, but unless we have the resources and relationships to act, we don’t have anything."

          "Q": "How will you use your candidacy/elected official position to engage more citizens in the political process?",
          "A": "One of the things I am most proud of is that we’ve opened up the Party. I believe in inclusiveness. People can talk about diversity, but unless those voices are given power and leadership, those are just feel good stats. We have the most diverse staff in DFL history and the most diverse leadership in DFL history. I urged for the addition of 50 at-large state central committee spots, most of which were filled by Bernie supporters, and 50 positions for local government officials. I am proud of the work we’ve done to engage more people in our party, not just so our stats would look better, but so we our party had the voices in it to reflect our values. We need an inclusive party if we are serious about what we believe in. I am looking forward to continuing my efforts to open up the party and building relationships with organizations like Our Revolution MN and Stand Up MN. One of the projects that I am really looking forward to is working with Our Revolution MN in filling leadership vacancies around the state with fresh voices. One Minnesota calls for statewide offices to service every part of the state. One of the paramount pieces of the plan is hiring people to staff those offices locally. Local people have local knowledge and insights that we can’t possible know from St. Paul. By giving support to the local party units, by hiring a local person who has the support of the state party, we will hopefully engage more people to the party in parts of the state that haven’t gotten much attention."

          "Q": "Describe your experiences and skill sets that will help you be effective in office.",
          "A": "I’ve spent my entire career in progressive politics. I got my start with Paul Wellstone and spent the next 27 years working on progressive campaigns. I have been involved in all levels of campaigns. From being Rep. Sandra Masin’s treasurer to leading Governor Dayton’s re-count efforts, to working on issue campaigns--I was a founding board member of Minnesotans United and ran the largest clean water initiative campaign in the nation. I know what it takes to run an effective campaign. I also know how to help other campaigns be successful. The DFL isn’t a candidate. Candidate’s win their campaigns. But the DFL can add value to a campaign and help push it over the top. I have shown that we can do this. Our elected officials endorsed me because the DFL under my leadership provided support to their campaigns that wasn’t there before. I have proven that we can build relationships between our partners. Our partners used to act around us because we didn’t have the capacity to be at the table. That’s not the case anymore. I set a goal to develop relationships that had been previously frayed and I accomplished that goal. We now have robust relationships with party leaders and activists, elected officials and candidates, progressive partners, allies and donors.. The DFL needs those partners if we want to be successful going forward. The part of politics everyone hates and doesn’t like to talk about--money. Grassroots aren’t free. Money shouldn’t matter more than people and that’s why the DFL invests money into people. This last year we had the most organizers on the ground in the history of the DFL. We had a base program that was devoted to organizing in communities of color, by hiring people from those communities. We developed an entire program, the Red to Blue program, to work with non-targeted candidates. These are vital programs, but they are expensive. We can’t go into debt every time there is an election. There is always an election. I’ve proven that I can raise the money to fund these programs. We’re looking at implementing one of the most ambitious statewide programs in DFL history. It’s expensive. Very expensive. My ability to raise funds for our programs and our electoral strategies is going to be very important going into this existential period in our state and country's history."

          "Q": "Citizens (people) before Corporations",
          "A": "Citizens United was a catastrophic ruling by the Supreme Court. The DFL believes that people are people. The Supreme Court's decision undermined the foundations of our democracy. As Lincoln so eloquently put it, our government should be for the people, by the people, and of the people. As the chair of the DFL I committed to fighting for the people. Our government should not be beholden to corporate interests over the interests of the people."

          "A": "Voters decide elections. They go to the polls. We need to make sure that we continue to put money into people power. Donors have a place in our party. Without them we can't pay for offices, hire staff like field organizers, build robust coordinated campaigns, or assist local party units. As previously mentioned, our small donor program is one of the best in the country, which was no small feat after inheriting a deteriorating program. I am going to continue to build this program and invest the funds in programs and resources that are centered on people and voters. I've been traveling the state recently, and I agree with what a lot of our rural Minnesota DFLers are saying--they need more resources. There's a cost to it. But raising the money doesn't mean we aren't focused on voters. It means that we value our local units enough to invest in their needs. I will continue to raise funds for our party and invest them in voters and our Party. The grassroots aren't free, but if we put our money into grassroots organizing and into the people, then we're putting our money where our mouth is."

          "Q": "People, Planet and Peace before Profits",
          "A": "The DFL is one of the most grassroots party in the nation. We have one of the largest state central committees with one of the most open processes to getting involved. What I've seen in my time as an activist and the chair is that our people are committed to people, the planet and peace before profits. It's not my place to make policy or take my personal beliefs and paste them onto the DFL. That's the type of top down approach that I think is inappropriate for a chair to assume. I will fight for our party values. I would have never gotten involved in this party if we weren't the party of the people, who believe in science, and who advocate for peace before profits. We may disagree with how all the pieces fit together. The last state central committee was an example of this. But, I am proud to be a part of a party that takes the time to have these disagreements and can come out stronger from them. I will always be guided by our common principles, no matter my position within the party."

That's why I have made it a continual goal of mine to open this party up like it has never been done before. Not just stats, but actually inclusion. We've done good work so far. I have worked hard to expand our constituency caucuses, and put members of those caucuses on the state executive board. My staff is the most diverse staff that the DFL has ever had. I advocated and fought for there to be 50 additional at-large delegates on the state central committee. We revamped our coordinated campaign into being a base organizing campaign, focusing on organizing people of color that historically don't receive the attention that they deserve during an election season. We hired people from those communities to organize. We have invested money, staff, time, and man power into campaigns like the Vote No campaign on the voter ID amendment because access to the ballot for ALL people is what Minnesota is about. I was a founding board member of Minnesotans United and worked tirelessly so that Minnesota would stand up for our fellow Minnesotans who faced discrimination because of who they loved. I ran the largest clean water initiative in the countries history because clean water is a right and not a privilege. Dignity, Equity and Justice for All Persons means that we don't back down when we know something is wrong. We don't shy away when the fight is tough, because we know what is right. People of color, immigrants, indigenous people, people with disabilities, are all a part of this party. This is anyone's party and we all have a responsibility to welcome new people in. I know that there are barriers for people and I am committed to continuing to knock those barriers down. It's my responsibility as chair to make sure that this party is the party of the people -- all people."

My support for Hillary though doesn’t negate the appreciation I have for Bernie Sanders. I’ve admired his work in the Senate and admire the grassroots campaign he ran and the energy he ignited.

Clearly, rural voters feel left behind by the DFL Party though I don't believe we lost to the Republicans. I believe we have not done our job to communicate to rural voters that we hear them, understand their struggles, and will stand with and fight for them. We need to begin having issue-based authentic conversations throughout rural Minnesota. Whether through a canvass or through local events, potentially with allied partners, we need to first listen to the concerns of folks and through these authentic conversations we can learn what resonates with people locally. Through this relationship building and potential organizing around local issues, and through telling stories of those impacted by negative policies, we can shape what will then become local campaign issues and can help shape messaging, that will speak to the community, as it's come from the community. It's a grassroots approach that relies on organizing instead of over-relying on polling and consultants."

Often there is a last-minute scramble to simply put someone on the ballot as a DFLer, simply to fill a spot. My plan is to build out a program for intentional recruitment, beginning now. I will invite the Legislative Caucuses to rethink how we recruit candidates together to build a bench to elect DFLers. Beginning now, we should assess the opportunities in each legislative district and in local non-partisan races. I'd like the State Party to work with the Caucuses and local Party leaders to identify potential candidates, ideally, arising out of local organizing/ advocacy. Not only do we need to reimagine how we recruit candidates, we need to commit to training and supporting local candidates -- particularly in rural MN, where we've suffered great losses. If we're asking a candidate to run and they courageously step forward, I believe we must clearly communicate what it will take and we must be willing to lend guidance and support, regardless if it is a targeted race, in order to build in areas where multiple runs may be required. I don't think candidate recruitment can be one size fits all. We need to tailor approaches that reflect the input of local folks."

I have made a public pledge regarding this issue: When the Party appears to favor one candidate over another it disrespects our democratic traditions and damages our ability to come together in unity. The Chair must remain neutral in everything the Party oversees so all stakeholders feel that the process has integrity and is fair. As your State Party Chair, I pledge to remain neutral in all state and local endorsement contests until after the appropriate convention. I further pledge to remain neutral in the presidential contest until after Minnesota's presidential primary. This neutrality will also apply to the State DFL office and staff."

          "A": "To lay the groundwork in order to win elections, following the time I've spent listening to DFL activists throughout the state during this campaign for Chair, we'll prioritize organizing throughout the state to listen to and gain an understanding of the concerns of voters. We will create a culture within the Party that is welcoming to new people and ideas, is inclusive, and that trusts that people know their communities best in order to build ownership of the Party. I will meet with and check in with Congressional District chairs regularly, to hear how the State Party can best support the work of local units in order to provide that support to grow and strengthen local units. I will meet with progressive allies and elected officials to explore partnering surrounding issue-based organizing and advocacy to build grassroots power together and relationships that may potentially evolve into doing electoral work together. I will meet with coordinated campaign partners to understand their individual goals and then convene the table to find common ground to begin laying the groundwork for a strong coordinated campaign, early. We'll build a strong team of staff members that will develop and execute communications and field plans with partners. And to fund this, I will re-establish and build new donor relationships with both institutional and movement donors, while expanding our grassroots donor base. All of this will build grassroots power to fuel our electoral infrastructure. I am honored to have served as State DFL Associate Chair for six years, from 2005 to 2011. In my first election cycle leading the Party in 2006, we won back the State Legislature and got Amy Klobuchar, Lori Swanson, Rebecca Otto, Mark Ritchie, Keith Ellison, and Tim Walz elected. In 2008, we got Al Franken elected. In 2010, Mark Dayton — the first DFL Governor elected in 24 years! When I started as Associate Chair in 2005, we held only two of the seven statewide offices. When I left in 2011, we held seven out of seven — and we have ever since. We did this by investing in organizing, getting out of Saint Paul, building a connected state, earning the trust of partners, building great teams and strong coordinated campaigns, and raised the money necessary. We can do this again."

          "Q": "What is your vision for the future of the DFL Party regarding the independent grassroots organizations (ie Black Lives Matter, Our Revolution, TakeAction Minnesota)?",
          "A": "The DFL Party must respect the people power that independent grassroots organizations build, and look to learn from them and potentially partner with them. It's going to take all of us to resist, fight and build with our current president and a Republican legislature. We can no longer afford to have the Party distance itself or compete with progressive organizations that are building power through organizing efforts that serve their memberships. And we need to be open to partnering with grassroots organizations. I have followed the lead of BLM from its inception, having marched, prayed, sang and participated in civil disobedience with them. Our Revolution has the potential to engage and mobilize folks around issues that are important to folks throughout Minnesota. And as a TakeAction Minnesota member, and a Minnesotans for a Fair Economy partner I have worked extensively with, I will look for ways to partner with TAMN. As an example, right now if I were Chair of the DFL Party, we'd be partnering with the Labor and community organizations packing the hearings opposing the Local Interference bills of the Republicans, which would prohibit local governments from being responsive to their residents with measures like Earned Sick and Safe time, which many organizations came together around to pass in Minneapolis and Saint Paul."

        {
          "Q": "What is your plan to raise money to support the DFL Party reforms and future campaigns?",
          "A": "Maintaining and establishing relationships with longtime Party donors, and clearly communicating how year-round issue-based organizing and building grassroots power will grow and strengthen the Party to prepare for elections. Through connecting with large numbers of grassroots activists and by showing up differently in communities throughout Minnesota, we'll increase our low-dollar donor base, which will build a connection with these voters."

        {
          "Q": "Why are you running for office?",
          "A": "I'm running to serve as the State Chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. In the 2016, the Republicans took over the Legislature. They won our one open congressional seat with a candidate you can hardly tell apart from Donald Trump. And Minnesota did the unthinkable -- we nearly went Trump. The Republicans came closer to winning our electoral votes than they have in 44 years. And we're the only state in the nation that went for Hillary that flipped a legislative chamber from Democratic to Republican. I don't believe the Republicans won. We didn't do our job. The Party failed to communicate to working people throughout our state, that we see and hear their struggles and will stand with and fight with them. Under the current leadership, the Party has moved away from investing in organizing, has been less clear in communicating that we stand with working people, has become more metro-centric, is losing its connection to our rural communities, and has moved away from truly coordinated electoral campaigns. And we have failed to engage our base communities around issues that affect their lives on an ongoing basis. Instead, the Party has over-relied on polling, consultants, mail and TV ads, rather than doing what we know works -- having effective conversations with voters. We lost legislative seats in 2014. We lost more legislative seats in 2016. We cannot afford this trend in 2018 and 2020 if we are to retain the governorship and have any say in redistricting. Moving a progressive agenda forward will be difficult. And as we face a Trump presidency and a Republican Legislature, we need new thinking. We need a Chair that values organizing and voter education, has demonstrated the ability to win elections and issue-based campaigns in innovative ways with strategic partners. And that has extensive experience in movement politics. Having successfully served as the DFL Party's Associate Chair from 2005-11 and as the Executive Director of Minnesotans for a Fair Economy from 2011-16, I am best prepared to help lift the DFL Party to new heights. I will share more about these two professional experiences below."

        {
          "Q": "What are your top three priorities once elected?",
          "A": "1. Invest in deep organizing. We need to spend time in communities throughout Minnesota, having issue-based conversations that are important to people, allowing us to understand one another and build relationships. Not only will this be helpful in shaping local messaging; it will help us identify local candidates and new people to invite into the Party. So many, particularly young people and women, were energized by last year's presidential election. They want to do meaningful work. I want them to land in the Minnesota DFL -- perhaps in their local organizing unit, perhaps in a constituency caucus, or perhaps through a progressive ally organization. And we can partner with organizations like Our Rev and TakeAction Minnesota for events like the recent informational and action meeting surrounding saving Obamacare, Medicare and Planned Parenthood funding. All of which, will allow us to engage people in our political and public lives.\n2. Convene the legislative caucuses, elected officials and party activists to rethink how we recruit local candidates to build a bench and elect DFLers, as explained earlier.\n3. Deepen and broaden our relationships with organized Labor and other progressive allies. We must partner in new ways to not only tell, but show, workers, immigrants, communities of color, LGBTQ folks, climate justice advocates, people of the Muslim faith and all faiths, that we stand with them and will fight with them. This could take the form of civic engagement, legislative advocacy, or direct action. The point is that we will break down the walls between the Party and outside groups that are doing powerful work year-round, helping change the narrative in Minnesota around economic, racial, social and environmental justice."

          "Q": "Describe your experiences and skill sets that will help you be effective in office.",
          "A": "I have been a community organizer for the last 30 years. My work in electoral and movement politics make me best suited to lead the DFL Party in the age of Trump and with a Republican Legislature, where new thinking will be required. I previously entered into Party leadership, serving as the State DFL Associate Chair in 2005, shortly after we lost the election to George W. Bush, and when we had a divided Legislature and a Republican governor. Folks felt deflated. We built a great teams. We invested in organizing and ran effective communications and field plans. In 2006, we took back the Legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar, Mark Ritchie, Lori Swanson, Rebecca Otto, Tim Walz (unseating a six-term Republican) and Keith Ellison (in a brutal primary campaign). In 2008 we elected Al Franken, unseating a Republican incumbent, and helped elect the President. In 2010 we helped elect the first DFL governor in 24 years! When I began in this role, the DFL Party held only two of the statewide offices. When I left in 2011 we held all seven, and have ever since. Since then I have served as the Executive Director of Minnesotans for a Fair Economy. MFE is an alignment of labor, faith and community groups addressing economic, racial, social and environmental justice issues. We have been successful in numerous coordinated campaigns addressing corporate accountability, income inequality and racial equity in workplaces, municipalities, at the Legislature and at the ballot box. Victories include helping to raise the minimum wage at the state level, going up against the Big Banks to pass the Homeowner's Bill of Rights to protect families against foreclosure, and passing earned sick and safe time in Minneapolis and St. Paul. One of the campaigns I'm most proud of is the Our Vote Our Future campaign. In 2012, the Republicans put on the ballot a constitutional amendment to require photo ID. A Star Tribune poll showed 80% support for photo ID. The current leadership, whose decision-making over-relies on polling, felt this fight was unwinnable. With our democracy at stake, our table decided that we couldn't not fight it. My team conducted the research and we put together a communications and field plan, and built out a campaign with partner organizations that defeated the amendment with 54% of the vote. Had we relied on the polling, many voices would have been left out of our elections. Instead, with a deep belief that tough campaigns can only be won with smart strategies and through organizing, we were successful by people talking to people throughout the state of Minnesota. My skills include the ability to build talented and creative teams to do hard things - win difficult electoral and advocacy campaigns by building people power through grassroots organizing. I'm an excellent manager, and oversee research, communications and field plan development and execution. I am skilled in building powerful strategic partnerships, in serving as a spokesperson, and in fundraising."

          "A": "Establishment politics has allowed for the concentration of wealth and power, and by extension, our democracy, into the hands of a very few. Change will only come from the grassroots. That is, organized people working in partnership, educating voters, electing progressive candidates in order to move forward a pro-worker agenda, racial equity, environmental justice, corporate accountability and more. Bernie Sanders's historic presidential campaign engaged, energized and mobilized grassroots support like nothing we've seen before. It's inspiring that Bernie's supporters have remained engaged through Our Revolution, which is a testament to the grassroots power that was built through the Sanders campaign. That is absolutely essential to creating change by moving forward a progressive agenda. I will stand and organize with members of Our Rev MN, both inside and outside of the Party, to continue to build power for the movement."

          "Q": "Do you support the current Super Delegate system? Why or Why Not?",
          "A": "No. Under our current system, Super Delegates do not represent the wish of the voters. If they can be reformed to better reflect the votes of the people, then the should be reformed. If no reform can be made, then we need to eliminate the Super Delegates completely."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Do you believe in presidential primary?",
          "A": "The primary is a good way to select a candidate, however we need to have a geographically diverse group of states vote early in the race. Currently, the first states to vote are predominantly white, rural states and the heavily conservative southern states. Having a diverse group of states vote earlier will help select a candidate that can win in the general election."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How will you bring rural, independent Democrats back into the party?",
          "A": "I will create a Rural Caucus and a Labor Caucus to help bring our forgotten base back to the party. I will also work to weed out corruption, whether it be an elected official or a party leader, we can not have corruption ruining our party. I would also create a mobile phone app to help connect voters, volunteers and candidates. This will help increase grassroots participation in our campaigns and can be used to help increase grassroots funding for our candidates, helping ween our party off the corporate dollar and giving the voters confidence that the Democratic Party is the people's party."

        {
          "Q": "How will you recruit new candidates to run for public office?",
          "A": "I will meet with progressives across the state and encourage them to run for office. I will also contact organizations such as Democratic Municipal Officials to get leads on Democrats already elected to city offices who would be willing to run for state level offices."

        {
          "Q": "What is the role of DFL Party officers in endorsing and supporting candidates?",
          "A": "The role of officers should be minimal. I believe Party officers should let the voters decide and only step into the process at the very end to either help solve a tie in the popular vote or to congratulate the winner of the popular vote."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How do you plan to win elections (ie. campaign political philosophy)?",
          "A": "We need candidates who can win in their districts and who are knowledgeable on a multitude of issues. We need to engage the voters of each district separately, letting the local party units and candidates form a message on their own and provide them with funding to meet their goals. Currently, the state party wastes tens of thousands of dollars on mailers in every district. These dollars would be better utilized going directly to campaigns and local party units who know what is the best approach to win their district. We also need to make sure there are plenty of debates, town halls and forums held to connect the candidates with the voters and to get the candidate's message and the party's message out to the voters directly."

          "Q": "What is your vision for the future of the DFL Party regarding the independent grassroots organizations (ie Black Lives Matter, Our Revolution, TakeAction Minnesota)?",
          "A": "I believe the DFL should get involved with social movements and grassroots movements that fit the party platform and that reflect our values. The party needs to recognize these groups and meet with their leaders and have an open dialogue with the members of these movements."
        },
        {
          "Q": "What is your plan to raise money to support the DFL Party reforms and future campaigns?",
          "A": "I want to hold fundraising events with every single organizing unit and help make sure the local party units have enough funding to run their campaigns effectively. I also want to create a mobile app to allow for quick and easy campaign donations directly to candidates or the party itself. Once we have a sufficient stream of grassroots funding, we can stop collecting money from the super PACs and corporations who are trying to buy our candidates."

          "A": "I love Minnesota and I believe getting involved in politics can make an impact on everyone's life and help make Minnesota a better place for all who wish to call it home. If elected as Vice Chair of the DFL, I hope to restore faith in party leadership and provide fresh ideas to the party."

          "A": "First, I will rebrand the party so people know we are the party of the people. Second, I hope to grow the party and make sure the majority of millennials become DFLers, keeping our progressive movement alive for decades. Third, I want to help end corruption in the party and in politics in general. If we can weed out corruption and restore the voter's faith in our political system, we can greatly increase voter turnout, making sure every voice is heard."

I help people from all walks of life and multiple nationalities on a daily basis. I have worked with elected officials from across the state to get funding for our highways, for renewable energy and for passenger rail projects."

I also was running for city council for a few months, during that time I raised a significant amount of money from grassroots donors and was proud to have put my progressive ideas front and center in a conservative town. I inspired many people to get involved in the political process during my campaign and hope to inspire more people to get involved in the future."

        },

          "Q": "Voters over Donors",
          "A": "The voters are our boss. We need to listen to the voters and ignore threats from the rich who think they can buy our elected officials. We can start listening to our donors once we have grassroots campaigns funded entirely by the people, for the people."

        {
          "Q": "People, Planet and Peace before Profits",
          "A": "The government was created to protect the people, not the profits of large corporations. We need to protect our environment and in doing so, we will be protecting our people. Peace needs to be maintained and that is why we need to reaffirm our support for organizations such as the United Nations and the Red Cross to help build bonds with countries across the globe and make sure America is still the leader of a truly free world and not an overly aggressive policeman."

          "A": "We should never allow a person to suffer due to their gender, race, sexuality, religion, age or nationality. Every person is born entitled to equality and should be treated with respect. I believe our current justice system needs to be reformed to make sure we do not have discrimination occurring against any group. Until we have true equality for all, we will always have a moral obligation to fight for the equality of our fellow men and women who need their voices heard."

          "A": "Though I was already active in politics before I knew about Bernie Sanders, I was inspired by him and his message and hope to help spread this inspiring message to as many as possible. I hope to gain the endorsement of Our Revolution MN to let people know what I stand for and to let them know that the progressive movement is a movement of young and rising political leaders such as myself who hope to make a positive impact in Minnesota and across the country."

          "A": "No, I don't support the current system. I elected by my neighbors to represent MN's 5th Congressional District, and I attended the DNC. As a delegate I worked hard to raise money to attend the convention. Bernie Sanders won MN with %61 percent of Minnesotans who caucused voting for him. At the convention that the super delegates from Minnesota voted for Hillary which did not represent the way Minnesotans voted at our caucuses. I believe in one person--one vote. We have the opportunity in Minnesota to reform our party by requiring that super delegates cast their votes for the candidate who won the state. I believe we should and can achieve reform on this issue. At the state convention, I along with a majority of state delegates voted to abolish the super delegate system. While we might not be able to change the national rule on super delegates, we can continue to work for change."
        },

          "Q": "Do you believe in presidential primary?",
          "A": "I do believe in a presidential primary. I was a delegate to the SD 60A, and our convention lasted the entire day which left out many, many people who could not afford to spend the day caucusing. I was one of several people who motioned the floor at my Senate District convention to move ahead with the Presidential voting so that we could hear from as many people as possible. A presidential primary will invite broader participation, and I welcome it. We will continue to caucus for state and local races and continue on in the tradition of having important caucus discussions at the state and local level."

          "Q": "How will you bring rural, independent Democrats back into the party?",
          "A": "I am from rural Minnesota. I was born in New Ulm, MN, a small town in the Minnesota River Valley. I understand the importance of relationships in rural Minnesota. I believe we need to continue to stand up and fight for our values as DFLers in rural Minnesota. I moved to Minneapolis as an adolescent and as an adult I have come understand the cultural landscape of both urban and rural communities. We can not allow the media or the GOP to play upon a perceived rural/urban divide in Minnesota. The media has coded 'rural' Minnesota as working class and white, and 'urban' Minnesota as home to People of Color. As a person of color, I know this is a myth. The first thing we need to do is push back against this stereotyping of who we are as a state. People in rural Minnesota are fighting for issues of racial equality and economic equity the same as people who live in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Second, in order to win back those voters who have may have voted for the Republican in this election cycle, we need to get our message out there and that message has to be focused on the economy. We need to adapt and change as engage voters on the issues that matter them. We need to support our party units across the state by following their lead. Party leaders and candidates need support from the State Party, not a DFL that is centralized in St. Paul."
        },

          "Q": "How will you recruit new candidates to run for public office?",
          "A": "We have a large number of individuals who joined the DFL as a result of Bernie Sanders campaign, and I am among this group of individuals who are working to understand how we can work to reform the DFL. As a Native person of mixed-heritage, I am hoping that by running for a statewide party leadership position that I will have inspired other people of color and indigenous people to run for office. I believe the power of storytelling in getting a progressive message to voters cannot be underestimated, and we have powerful stories to tell. I believe that helping first time candidates tell their stories is key to helping them launch their campaign for public or party office. I have been working on an audio documentary (for public radio) that started out as a conversation between friends and blossomed into a storytelling project. I am writing out the answers to this questionnaire our documentary aired today on MPR to an audience of 900,000 people. Our candidates will not be creating audio documentaries per se but I believe my engagement with storytelling and media is a yyuuuuuge asset to our party as we seek to build a deeper bench over the next two years and get our message out to votes. We need engage new candidates. As we do become more focused in our storytelling, we are going to attract new candidates."

        {
          "Q": "What is the role of DFL Party officers in endorsing and supporting candidates?",
          "A": "I believe the Vice Chair needs to remain neutral in primaries while votes decide on endorsements, and work diligently to support our endorsed candidates. I have heard from people of color and indigenous people that the endorsing process feels like 'insider' politics. We need to understand that the endorsement process may be keeping potentially great candidates from running. We need to encourage broad participation at our local party units without suggesting to individuals that a candidate needs to prove themselves over and over again without a modicum of real support before the DFL will support them as a candidate. We need to grow as a party to support people as they enter into the party."

I support the platform endorsed by Our Revolutions national organization, and have worked with the Our Revolution MN to work toward building our platform. We need to engage voters through storytelling and personal connection (traditional campaign techniques), we need to support candidates in places across the state where they have been ignored in the last election cycle. As vice chair I want to work on a micro-donating program starting at the $5/week level to encourage participation and build momentum. We need to listen to candidates tell us what works. Many of the candidates have said the party relies too heavily on polling data to decide where to spend money and what issues to emphasize. We need to engage and listen to voters and support candidates."

          "A": "We need to work with partners from BLM, Our Revolution MN, and Take Action MN, WANDA and others. We need a statewide strategy for working with our partners. The party needs to take responsibility for organizing statewide to win elections. We should encourage individuals to be involved in both the party and with organizations, but the party needs to stand up for our values and lead. I believe that individuals who serve in both capacities can help craft an activist strategy that will be effective in winning votes."

          "A": "As Vice Chair, I want to lead a micro-donating fundraising program to raise significant sums of money for the DFL. We still need to fight to get big money out of politics through campaign finance reform. We as a party can work to make small or micro donating an important feature of the party that works to invite participation on campaigns and build momentum. Communities of color that I have spoken with over the past month are excited about this program as it has traditionally been the way communities of color have raised support for candidates."

As a result of those decisions voters don't see DFL candidates standing up for their values. Again, we need to support candidates in all areas of the state, fight for votes, and when in office fight for voters. The party can do that by taking on the role of fighting the GOP when they go low."

          "Q": "What is the role of DFL Party officers in endorsing and supporting candidates?",
          "A": "I'm sure this question is meant to be framed in the sense that how should Party Officers act before the official party endorsement/nomination is determined. There are rules for Party Officers to not publicly endorse at the level they represent or below. I believe that is a good system. As for endorsing above the State Level, I can see arguments for and against that. As for supporting a candidate, it's a slippery slope to not be able to allow a citizen advocate for their beliefs even if it's in private. I understand why the question was asked, and I can appreciate"

        },
        {
          "Q": "Why are you the best person to address these issues?",
          "A": "Because I grew up, live, and have organized in Greater Minnesota for almost the entirety of my political activism. I have experienced good communications tools, and not so good. And because I have a contemplative side to my activism that generally only speaks up when there is something important to say."

          "Q": "How will you use your candidacy/elected official position to engage more citizens in the political process?",
          "A": "I will continue to advocate neighbors and friends to engage in the caucus/convention process, the volunteer work that comes along with political parties and campaigns, and to encourage friends, family and colleagues to run for office themselves."

          "Q": "Describe your experiences and skill sets that will help you be effective in office.",
          "A": "As far as the technical aspects of being Secretary, I've been doing that for the past 5.5 years with little complaint. As for the other aspects of being an officer of the state party, like I mentioned before, I live and grew up in Greater Minnesota, and know what it's like to organize here, as a professional staffer, and as a former Chair of a local unit, and still active in Winona County DFL business. I am a good listener, and as I mentioned before, contemplative, understand, and curious. I also always strive to make sure that people are being heard, and also being respectful to one another."

          "Q": "Is there anything else you would like the Our Revolution MN Endorsements Committee to know about you?",
          "A": "I graduated from high school in 2002 and headed to NYU in New York City to earn my Bachelor of Science degree in Social Studies Education, which I received in May 2006. I followed my heart back to Minnesota and ended up in La Crescent (in Houston County, where I grew up). I became heavily active in my local DFL Unit, Houston County, in 2007-2008. Starting as what was then called the Affirmative Action Officer. I subsequently was elected as a Director to the CD1 Executive Committee. Starting in July 2008 I worked for the DFL Coordinated Campaign as the paid organizer for Fillmore, Houston and Winona Counties, and I remained employed through the hand recounting of Senator Franken's race. In late summer 2009 I was elected Vice Chair of Houston County DFL. During the 2010 convention season I was elected Chair. I again joined the DFL Coordinated Campaign in 2010 as a staffer to organize in the 9.5 counties of southwest Minnesota and worked through the hand recounting in Governor Dayton's race. In February 2011 I ran for State Party Secretary and lost. In August of that year the previous Secretary resigned, I decided to run again, and I was elected State Party Secretary that September. April 2012 found me joining the staff of Minnesotans United for All Families as an organizer in Fillmore, Houston, and Winona Counties. It was grueling campaign and I was elated on election night when we made history in defeating an anti-LGBT constitutional amendment for the first time. I look forward to continue having the opportunity to share my experience with the DFL in organizing in Greater Minnesota. I headed to Saint Paul in early 2013 to work as a Page for the Minnesota House of Representatives, and was witness to that historic Legislative session as the right to marry was extended to all Minnesotans, along with so many other monumental steps that benefitted our state. I moved to Winona in the fall to organize Outreach for MNSure in all of southeast Minnesota, and did that until they decided to change up the program. And in Winona I have remained. I have spent most of my life here in Greater Minnesota, and cherish that opportunity to continue to reach out to DFLers outside of the Twin Cities. I know and recognize the DFL fell short in Greater MN in the 2016 election cycle and being a proud resident of Greater MN, it is hard for me to accept that the DFL had a hard time reaching out to and connecting with my own friends and family. This must change and I will work hard to ensure it does. It is my experience and perspective as a resident of Greater Minnesota that makes me different and if I am re-elected as State Secretary, I will continue to work hard to ensure the DFL is active in every community."

          "Q": "Do you support the current Super Delegate system? Why or Why Not?",
          "A": "No. The current Super Delegate system does not appropriately represent the voices of the people. Super Delegates essentially maintain the establishment by providing an individual person a vote that is equivalent to thousands of citizens. As we saw in the 2016 elections, Super Delegates often vote contrary to the will of the people they represent. The Super Delegate system is inherently undemocratic."

          "Q": "How will you bring rural, independent Democrats back into the party?",
          "A": "The DFL has lost critical votes across the state because we as a party have not been listening to the people. Rural Minnesotans have long seen these problems coming, and have tried to help party leaders and DFLers from the cities understand. It is essential that we start listening now. As Secretary, I plan to work with the newly established Technology Task Force and with leadership of local units to improve DFL communications in such a way that we are more connected state-wide than we have been in years."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How will you recruit new candidates to run for public office?",
          "A": "This is not the primary job of State Party Secretary, but I will support the efforts of the local units themselves. I plan to ensure they have what they need to communicate with one another and share ideas across the entirety of the state. The more connected we are, the better capacity we have to learn from one another when it comes to recruiting and running DFL candidates."
        },
        {
          "Q": "What is the role of DFL Party officers in endorsing and supporting candidates?",
          "A": "The State Executive Committee has a responsibility to support local units and remain neutral at all times until formal endorsement proceedings have been completed. Once a candidate is endorsed, it is essential that we rally behind that candidate and support them in every possible way we can to ensure DFL candidates are ELECTED. I've heard this story far too often--candidates are endorsed but then find themselves without solid support from the DFL in the lead up to election day. Once again, I feel like this problem could be improved by connecting the party better. Communication is one of the most important things an organization can foster within its ranks. Communication fosters the sharing of ideas, and in this case can help rally support for a DFL-endorsed candidate across the state."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How do you plan to win elections (ie. campaign political philosophy)?",
          "A": "I'm a big believer that stories connect us as a people. I think we need to take our organizing back to the grassroots, where it has demonstrated the most effectiveness in years past. When we empower individuals to share their stories and spread the word about our values and the organizations and candidates that represent them, we will surely take back the state."
        },
        {
          "Q": "What is your vision for the future of the DFL Party regarding the independent grassroots organizations (ie Black Lives Matter, Our Revolution, TakeAction Minnesota)?",
          "A": "I think the DFL Party would be missing out on a big opportunity (and I would even question our continued legitimacy) if we did not only embrace but actively work with grassroots organizations such as Our Revolution, Black Lives Matter, and Take Action. These organizations form as a result of shared stories and deep commitments to actively improving the state of Minnesota and the nation. In December, I myself helped to found a grassroots organization called Women & Advocates Minnesota. So I understand, perhaps more than other candidates, just how important the work of these organizations really is in uniting people around common values and goals."

        {
          "Q": "What is your plan to raise money to support the DFL Party reforms and future campaigns?",
          "A": "As Secretary, it is not within the scope of my position to lead fundraising efforts. That being said, I believe philanthropy is key for the success of a massive statewide organization such as the DFL--especially if we hope to take back the state in a big way in the 2018 elections. I think fundraising is also dependent largely on communications. If we are able to effectively connect across the state, local unit leaders can share what fundraising efforts are working well for their area and help others that may be having more difficulty."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Why are you running for office?",

        {
          "Q": "What are your top three priorities once elected?",

Transition the Yahoo Group (currently only utilized by 1/3rd of the members of the State Central Committee) to a more comprehensive community group tool that can integrate other platforms, allowing individuals and local units multiple communication options while also connecting them even more effectively to the whole of the DFL. 2. Educate. Launch an extensive education campaign for both new and experienced DFL leaders around current technology and communication methods, which will help them stay connected and be more effective in their positions. I envision both face-to-face education at caucuses, meetings, and conventions, as well as online learning modules on the DFL website. 3. Ensure Ongoing Quality. Put into place a permanent Quality Improvement (QI) team for communication within the party to constantly evaluate what is working, what isn't working, and develop & implement effective solutions as problems are discovered."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Why are you the best person to address these issues?",
          "A": "The DFL Secretary is the party organizer in a literal sense, organizing and processing documents, as well as managing communications party-wide, but specifically within the State Central Committee. Most people who know me will tell you that I am a born organizer, and I intend to work tirelessly to make the DFL communicate better. I've done this professionally in my career as a pediatric nurse in a primary care clinic, and for two organizations: Our Revolution Minnesota and Women & Advocates Minnesota While the day to day operations of the State Party Secretary are essential to the functioning of the organization, I believe my particular drive and skill set equip me to take the role to a new level--improving DFL communications in such a way that will bind us strongly together and better equip us to achieve success in the months and years ahead."
        },
        {
          "Q": "How will you use your candidacy/elected official position to engage more citizens in the political process?",
          "A": "As Secretary, I plan to ensure the DFL is as transparent and neutral as possible. I think the DFL's lack of transparency and neutrality is one of the primary reasons more democratic-voting Minnesotans are not involved in and supportive of the party. The same can be said of individuals who do not typically participate in any capacity in the political process. The DFL--like the GOP, and perhaps even more so--is viewed as simply an arm of the establishment and not as a truly representative body of the people. Improving communications is one way the DFL could counter these views, by proving that we are truly open, inclusive, transparent, and a collective voice of the people of Minnesota."

        {
          "Q": "Describe your experiences and skill sets that will help you be effective in office.",
          "A": "In my professional life, I served as a personnel security officer during my time in the military and was responsible for maintaining an entire brigade’s personnel security files, as well as overseeing completion of hundreds of security clearances prior to two deployments--a process that required meticulous organization and attention to detail. As a pediatrics nurse in a primary care clinic, I manage tasks and oversee our “in-basket”, pulling and opening 50 to 100+ electronic patient records on a daily basis, ensuring tasks are thoroughly completed in a timely manner. In my volunteer time, I’ve lead communications and internal operations for two organizations, including Our Revolution Minnesota. I am currently working as an organizer with Women & Advocates Minnesota--a new organization which I helped to found in early December. I manage the WANDA Slack channel (a communications application), the Google working documents of our five committees, draft and send out email blasts via MailChimp to our organization’s membership, manage and update a running membership list, and respond pleasantly and in a timely manner to direct messaging via email, Facebook, and through our website."

The people in this state and our nation have lost their power, and it is being even further drained and handed over to corporate billionaires by the current presidential administration.

The DFL is here to serve the people of Minnesota and not the corporations or wealthy democrats who may hope to sway our party's favor monetarily. As a member of the DFL State Executive Committee, I plan to hold others accountable for neutrality and integrity at all times. Money is an important part of the work that we do, but it absolutely cannot be prioritized over the voice of the people--who must always be our number one priority."

People, planet, and peace will always come first before profit. As the party becomes better connected with me as Secretary, DFLers will be empowered to stand more strongly together against elected officials, corporations, and legislation that puts people, planet, or peace at risk."

          "A": "Dignity, equity, and justice for all people should be the very foundation of the DFL, a future that we must strive for tirelessly. Now more than ever, we need to stand strongly in support of our most marginalized and raise up their voices. As Secretary, I will do everything in my power to ensure all people-- regardless of race, religion, gender, identity, sexual orientation, age, or socioeconomic status--have a fair and equal voice at the DFL table."

I believe the progressive platform is the future of the democratic party nationally and the DFL here in Minnesota."

Sanders for president and believe wholeheartedly in his platform to this day. Sen. Sanders and I aligned most closely with regard to the following key issues: income inequality, money in politics, climate change, universal healthcare, and foreign policy. Since his loss to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary, I have been heeding his call to continue the Revolution. My candidacy for DFL Secretary is part of my answer to that call."

Currently the Super Delegate system has 15% of the vote which can make the difference in tight races, when the deciding factor of tight races should be who gets more votes from the regular people. The fact is that it sends a bad message to the voters. Basically it says that Democratic voters are not welcome unless they vote the way the establishment wants them to vote.

          "A": "During my campaign I have made sure to call all of Greater Minnesota SCC delegates first to understand what went wrong and to listen. I am the only candidate in my race to attend Congressional District meetings in Greater Minnesota. I listened to DFL Leaders in Morris (CD 7), Grand Rapids (CD 8) and had someone from my team drive to Mankato (CD 1) to speak on my behalf since it was the same day as CD 8's meeting. I showed up and that is half the battle with folks in Greater Minnesota. Showing up is what I plan to do as DFL State Treasurer. I plan on hosting Town Halls across the state and especially in Greater Minnesota to understand and listen to their concerns. Additionally as Treasurer I plan on supporting the Greater Minnesota DFL Party Unit Treasurers. I had a conversation with one party unit chair who was also Treasurer because no one wanted to do it after one mistakenly broke campaign finance law and received a huge fine. There needs to be people in Party leadership that are willing to show up in these communities and I have and I will. Finally we lost a lot of union/ labor voters this last election because they did not feel like we were the party for them. I am the only candidate out of all Party office races that is a union member. I also am on the Executive Board of AFSCME Council 5. I will say we need to connect with our union brothers and sisters much more than we have this past election to win back Greater Minnesota. There is no winning formula for Greater Minnesota without Unions."

          "A": "I want to make this party more easily accessible. I had no idea how to join the SCC except someone told me who was already on the SCC. This means it is way too insider. Most people do not even know what the SCC even is! That is one example of why this Party needs to become more accessible and with more access comes more talent for people to run for public office.

          "A": "I think everyone even in DFL Party leadership has a right to have their opinion and preferences in races. However they must not abuse their power to tip the scale for the candidate of their choice. It is a fine line to draw between preferring a candidate and supporting a candidate. As Party officers we must be objective and plan to help whichever candidate that gets the endorsement."

        {
          "Q": "How do you plan to win elections (ie. campaign political philosophy)?",
          "A": "I think the strategy has many essential factors to it. The first is picking a candidate that can win, someone who has the community ties and the grit to win. Secondly getting a team together of the right people who can make sure all the moving parts of a campaign are taken care of is essential. Third the party must provide robust data for the candidate to use for door knocking and phone banking. Also the Party should provide a thorough analysis of the district to the candidate by outlining the assets and challenges in winning the district. Fourth, campaigns need to be funded so we need to at least provide a baseline fund for every race with a DFL endorsed candidate, and give more money to swing districts. Also In-Kind contributions such as lawn signs, mailings and fliers are essential. Finally we need to get other organizations on board to connect the candidate with the community, for instance if there are a lot of Somali speakers in the district, we need to have some Somali organizations brought on board to help. To accomplish this we need to ensure these community organizations that we have their best interest at heart."

          "A": "We need to build trust with many of these organizations because a lot of them do not believe that the DFL represents them. The first step is to build trust and let them know we have their back and their best interest politically. However beyond that I think we need to bring people who are in those organizations into DFL Leadership as well. Organizations like BLM, TakeAction and OurRev all have different goals that the Party needs to speak to. We cannot afford to be watered down in our beliefs as a Party anymore. Too much is at stake to ignore these grassroots organizations and go at it alone."

          "Q": "What is your plan to raise money to support the DFL Party reforms and future campaigns?",
          "A": "We need to harness the energy from the anger and disdain that the people have of the current disastrous presidential administration. Many people want to take action now and we need to make it easy for them to do that through donations. The big donors will not raise money to reform the DFL so that means we need to get many small or micro donations to help. Also community organizations and unions can play a huge role in this."

There is a man as our president who thinks people like my family are rapists and drug dealers which has never solidified so much resolve to fight back in my life. I also want to make sure our Party speaks to the new generation of people and that we develop new leaders for the future. Our Party needs to prepare for the fast changes and huge shifts that are coming all over from globalism to climate change.

That will be my main role and the most critical part of the office of Treasurer. With this also I want to present our financial data and educate campaigns and treasurers on where we are standing politically. My second priority is to speak up for voices usually unheard or not at the table in Party leadership. I will be the first Latino to have the role of DFL Party State Treasurer. Now more than ever it is important that the communities that will be under attack must be spoken for and advocated for. My third priority is to show up and reach out. I plan to host Town Halls across the state listening in on why people feel the way they do about the election and our Party. I also want to reach out to communities that do no trust our Party and make sure they are brought in so that they can feel included."

        {
          "Q": "Why are you the best person to address these issues?",
          "A": "I am the best person for DFL State Treasurer because I have the quantitative background to understand financial reports and to communicate our Party's finances to people who are not financially savvy. I also am a very outgoing and energetic person who is willing to put in the hard work and long hours to meet people, connect people and build our party. I have the unrelenting work ethic to make sure our Party succeeds."

        {
          "Q": "How will you use your candidacy/elected official position to engage more citizens in the political process?",
          "A": "I plan to reach out to communities that are usually underrepresented in Party leadership. There is no reason that we show up to certain communities in October when the election is in November. We need to be there all of the time and build community ties that are deep and not seasonal, especially now more than ever is this necessary. I speak Spanish and will use this to connect to communities and I believe we need to make the party more language accessible for all. Showing up will be half the battle, connecting will be the other half."

          "Q": "Describe your experiences and skill sets that will help you be effective in office.",
          "A": "I am currently the Housing Choice Voucher Program Analyst i.e. the analyst for the Section 8 Program of Minneapolis. We are the largest public housing authority in the state and I personally forecast, monitor, and oversee a $41 million budget that serves 5,500 low income families and around 17,000 people. I must be data driven, detail oriented, and have a clear understanding of our financial reports. If I make a mistake and over forecast our budget then we overspend and dip into much needed financial reserves. On the other hand, if I under forecast our budget then I leave millions of dollars on the table that could have housed families and HUD takes the money back. I have a critical, high pressure job and I still have the energy to do all that I do outside of work like union organizing, revitalizing the Latino caucus, etc. I have worked very hard to learn advanced statistics in my graduate program at Columbia University in New York City where I earned a Master's Degree in Political Science with a focus on International Economics. Besides my quantitative background, I also have the personality to be a leader of the Party. I am outgoing and high energy with a clean understanding of Minnesota and the political climate. I can adjust to many venues and groups of people. I will go above and beyond the requirements of the DFL State Treasurer's office."

        {
          "Q": "Citizens (people) before Corporations",
          "A": "I definitely believe in 'people over corporations' regardless of citizenship status. Corporations are job creators but I'm not going to be okay with compromising our principles as a party so that those jobs exist. Corporations need to be held accountable that is why I will be scrupulous in ensuring they do not break campaign finance law and donate to candidates."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Voters over Donors",
          "A": "Number one I am not running a campaign to raise money, however as DFL State Treasurer I will have a unique role in overseeing the financial statements of the party. With that being said, I will ensure that all of our financials are abiding by campaign finance law. However, to go beyond that I will advocate that our financial position should not compromise our beliefs. That means encouraging smaller donations from many people as opposed to huge donations from a few that expect something in return."

          "Q": "People, Planet and Peace before Profits",
          "A": "I have never worked in the private industry since I know most of the time it is profits and board rooms over people and employees. Our planet is in danger and we need to allocate party resources to environmentally active candidates to combat climate change."

        {
          "Q": "Dignity, Equity and Justice for All Persons",
          "A": "I truly have a conviction to this as I work every day working to more efficiently provide affordable housing to low income families. Additionally as a Chicano I know what it is like to be on the receiving end of racist remarks and sentiments and racial equity will be an essential issue to address in our generation. The US is getting browner and if we leave communities of color behind the US as a whole will decline."

        {
          "Q": "Why is an Our Revolution MN endorsement important to you?",
          "A": "I see Our Revolution as a movement that advances the ideals of economic justice and inclusion. Also it is an organization that is championing the issues important to my age group that I relate to. Our Revolution is gaining steam, notoriety and respect among Party leaders. I want to work to change the Party in ways I see Our Revolution also wants to see changed. I am friends with many people in Our Revolution and I am inspired by their energy and passion. Our Revolution is growing and I want to be a part of that."

        {
          "Q": "Which candidate did you support for president in the 2016 Minnesota caucuses 2016 and why?",
          "A": "To be honest I was working on the Ruben Vazquez campaign that day and I didn't want to take a side. My community was what mattered first since we were under attack on day one of Trump's announcement, so I wanted to do all I can to get Latinos in office. So I was going to vote blue regardless whoever won. I did not like the corporatism of Hillary supporters nor later did I like the 'Bernie or Bust' crowd that didn't see stopping Trump at all costs as a priority. I believe inequality is the greatest injustice of our time, and Bernie is speaking truth to those issues. However I also believe globalization is here to stay, I am a globalist and believe we as a world are getting more interconnected as technology improves. In the end I don't at all want to be defined by any one presidential candidate. However, I am reading 'Our Revolution' and 'The Speech' still."

          "Q": "Is there anything else you would like the Our Revolution MN Endorsements Committee to know about you?",
          "A": "I have attended a few meetings and love the energy and the ideals. I think that Our Revolution is a movement of our time as millennials and I want to be a part of that movement from the inside of the DFL. If I am privileged to earn your endorsement I will always have a line of communication open to Our Revolution. I hope Our Revolution can get more involved in the SCC and even the UDF to make sure we are the future of the DFL. Together we can get a lot done and move this state even more progressive than before. We have a lot of work ahead of us! I would love to stop by and talk with people more or have a phone conversation as well. I apologize for being unavailable last time as I was moving into my new condo I bought. I truly believe we are going to make a progressive comeback! La lucha sigue juntos!"

          "A": "I think that the super delegate system is flawed; it allows the people at the top to continue making all the decisions. I would publically support any measure to get rid of the super delegate system, or bind super delegates to vote with their districts/states."

        {
          "Q": "Do you believe in presidential primary?",
          "A": "I think presidential primaries are the only way to be inclusive; making the presidential primary process be done through a caucus means a lot of voices are dropped because the day the caucus are held are not always times that work for everyone. Having a primary allows for all voices to be heard, and it doesn't force independents to declare a party if it's an open primary. I would only support a primary if it important."

Invest in the development of our volunteers, so that they can take the next level in their involvement in the party whether that be through being an delegate or running for office. We must center their needs, and work with them to create the changes that they want in their districts."

I would like to see the leaders of these groups leading the DFL, and driving the work that we do as a party."

          "A": "Money is important, but I think the most important thing is to raise the base, and the voter base. With that we can build a grassroots effort by having our people donate, and direct the work, and how we're spending the funds."
        },
        {
          "Q": "Why are you running for office?",

          "Q": "Citizens (people) before Corporations",
          "A": "We lose elections when we put the priorities of corporations over people. We must tell the stories of our people, and how their lives are effected. For instance, we know that big corporations don't want to pay their fair shares of taxes - we have to ensure that we a fighting to make sure that they are paying their fair share, because when they don't pay the middle class has to fill those gaps causing them to bring home smaller checks that cannot sustain their families."

          "Q": "Voters over Donors",
          "A": "Big donors don't win elections. People do. Voters should always be our first priorities. We should never have to abstain from a vote, or not support initiatives because our donors don't want us. As a public servant, you work for the people and that is the bottom line."

LGBT folks should not be discriminated against, and should be allowed to live with their partners and loved ones, and have a family just like everyone else. Seniors deserve to retire with dignity and respect, and that means that we aren't raising the retirement age, and putting absurd caps on social securities. Black, brown, and native folks deserve feeling safe in their communities, and not being afraid of their law enforcement. Our muslims brothers and sister should be allowed to openly practice their religions without being painted as terrorist.
