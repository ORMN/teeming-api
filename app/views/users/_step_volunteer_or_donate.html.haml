  Organizations don't run on passion alone, as much as we wish they would. Member donations of both time, skills, and
  money are necessary to help us fulfill our mission. In an effort to build up an independent progressive movement in
  Minnesota (and all around the US), we need to stop relying on big money donors and start relying on our own skils,
  effort and money. Bernie's campaign was fueled by small donations from all over the country. We can do the same
  here and maintain the independence we need to fight big money's take over of our politics.

  OurRevolutionMN does not take money from corporations, political parties or the government

%h4 Donations

Please donate, as much or as little as you can by using the DONATE button below. May we suggest $27? It was the average
contribution to Bernie's presidential run.
